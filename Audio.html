    <p>My audio project takes on a rainy Monday morning. The idea of the story is simple, the process of waking
and that faithful routine. It starts with the sound on the window. To some, our first sound in the morning is that
of outside.In this case, rain hitting the window right before the alarm goes off. Followed the sounds we make
waking up and the movements, to that first greeted by a family member, in this case a dog. And wrapping it up
to our first cup of coffee to start off the day. Is a very simple story and straightforward but I wanted to recreate
something we can relate to. I recorded five sounds myself using my blue yeti microphone. Four of the sounds
were recorded in my home and one at work that of the coffee machine. As per the effects i used four which i
combined to make two fluent sounds, the alarm and the rain. The most challenging part was removing sounds
from my mic, it captured minor sounds such as my fan. I struggled for a while. So I turned to youtube tutorials
for some help and a lot of trial and error. However I am happy with the end result. Testing it out with my kids
and friends, they were able to see the story I wanted to tell.
