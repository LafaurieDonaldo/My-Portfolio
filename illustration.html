The image I chose for this project was that of myself and my family at New York Comic Con 2022. Our 
cosplay was of the akatsuki, a clan that's made up of unique members for the anime Naruto. My inspiration came 
from the show. I wanted to recreate the akatsuki where the show takes place in japan. I really didn't run into much 
trouble this time around. I had the vision, I found the images I wanted. The only trouble I had was with the fog and 
the crows. But after a bit of effects, filtering soft light, and making it blended nicely. The other issue was more of a 
perfectionist problem, I wanted a fall , gloomy look. After a tutorial on youtube I added the fall effect on the image. 
I'm proud of the results.
