  <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey"> After Effects Project "Neon City"
    by Donaldo A. Lafaurie</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>For this animation project I wanted to create something simple. When it comes to emotions I believe 
anger is one that can easily be identified so I went in that direction. Using my storyboard the story is simple: a 
square shape is going at high speed in the city; it eventually bumps into a ball that is idle enjoying the city 
scenery. As they clashed the road runner sends the circle into the air. By this interruption the ball gets really 
angry, going into the air transforming into a bigger version of itself returning the favor right back to the square. 
Realizing what has occurred and her power revealed she disappears at high speed. A very simple story, when I 
first created it, it was a simple meadow with blues greens and red for anger. But I have a problem when I feel I'm 
not challenged and I felt my animation was a bit boring. Thus I decided why not go with a cyberpunk feel. I had 
recently watched cyberpunk 2077 on Netflix and played the game so I used it as inspiration for the animation. 
The colors are all neon pinks, purples, blues. All cyberpunk feel. Small effects such as lightning and shape 
transformation will showcase the anger of the shape to tell the story. I wish I had more time is on a great 80% i 
would have loved to add more. But for what it is, I'm happy with it.
